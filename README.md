## üëãüèª   Hi there, I am Camilo

As a frontend developer at Nova Transmedia, I work on creating web and mobile applications that enhance user experience and engagement. I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to build responsive and interactive interfaces that meet the clients' needs and expectations. I have contributed to multiple projects, such as a website and app that allow teachers to manage their students' grades.

I am also a motivated and curious learner, pursuing two degrees in computer software engineering and languages. I have completed several online courses and certifications in frontend development, such as the ones offered by Platzi, where I learned ReactJS, React Native, and Redux. I am fluent in English, Spanish, and in a little bit, French, and I enjoy exploring new technologies and challenges.

üå±   Now I am working in ReactJS and React Native projects.

üí¨   Ask me about whatever you want. I am interested in helping and sharing.

### ‚öíÔ∏è   My projects:
[TodoAPP](https://camiloprogtodo.netlify.app/)
Schedule your tasks of the day or week, it will still appear when you close and open the website because, this app uses localStorage.

[SearchMovies](https://camiloprogsearchmovies.netlify.app/)
Go and try to search your favorite movie, also, you can organize them by alphabetical order.

Comming soon...
More projects with React, maybe a Pokedex using Redux :)
