### Hi there üëã

üëãüèª   Hi there, I am Camilo
banner that says Alejandra Camacho - Software development enfineer

As a frontend developer at Nova Transmedia, I work on creating web and mobile applications that enhance user experience and engagement. I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to build responsive and interactive interfaces that meet the clients' needs and expectations. I have contributed to multiple projects, such as a website and app that allow teachers to manage their students' grades.

I am also a motivated and curious learner, pursuing two degrees in computer software engineering and languages. I have completed several online courses and certifications in frontend development, such as the ones offered by Platzi, where I learned ReactJS, React Native, and Redux. I am fluent in English, Spanish, and in a little bit, French, and I enjoy exploring new technologies and challenges. You can see my portfolio and try some of my projects here: https://portfoliocamiloprog.netlify.app/

üå±   Now I am working in ReactJS and React Native projects.

üí¨   Ask me about whatever you want. I am interested in helping and sharing.
